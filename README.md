# groupbox

With groupbox you can forget about publishing your photos when you go out. It is as simple as creating an event at our mobile app. It will automatically sync with your Dropbox folder and at the time of the event, groupbox will start posting to your selected social networks.

We currently have support for:

* Facebook
* Twitter

The good thing is, since its handled by Dropbox, you can invite anyone to that folder and kick in with the photos.

We will be working in adding more features as we go.
